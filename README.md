# Samosa Selector

This Project is the second Codepath Lab in Web102 

In it the project uses the UseState and Set to Change the Score by Clicking the Samosa

By reaching a certain score you can select the Double Stuff, PartyPack or Full Feast to increase your Clicking Power⚡⚡⚡

Here's an example of the Lab Working:
